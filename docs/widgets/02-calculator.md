A dual-mode calculator that can handle evaluating different arithmetic expressions **and** provides the ability to graph select functions, accessed through a minimalistic user interface. The calculator allows users to keep track of their previously inputted expressions and allows them to save a `.png` file of the calculator's display and history.
